Why we feel tired even if we just sit and do nothing?

the value of meaning is to feel the connection between ourselves with the future, others and the world. We can feel we are parts of the world. 

Here is the answer to this question:

With nothing to do, we subconsciously spend energy&time to figure out what’s the relationship between their current and future, ourselves and others,  inner mind and the world. 

In addition, if we are struggle with trivial things. We will soon feel exhausted. It is because we are like small screws on the eiffel towel. Subconsciously we spend to identify there value in the world. The more busy we are, the worse we feel. We could feel abandoned by others and the world. 

Thus, the suggestion given is focusing on the meaningful thing, which can increase the connection between ourselves and others&worlds. That could be one main reason why many people hope to change the world!
